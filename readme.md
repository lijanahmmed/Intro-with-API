## Intro with API

This project introduces the basics of working with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in web development. APIs let your app communicate with other software and get or send data.  

In this project, you will learn how to:  
- Understand what an API is and how it works  
- Make HTTP requests using tools like `fetch` or `axios`  
- Use **fetch** to get data from an API  
- Create a **loadData** function to load data asynchronously  
- **Display data** dynamically on the web page  
- Handle JSON responses and display data dynamically  
- Manage errors and asynchronous operations with `async/await`  

This repository is a beginner-friendly starting point for learning how to fetch, load, and display data from APIs in your web applications.
